# Dual Number System

This is an animation I created to learn the manim library and also for a small project.
It's aimed at high school student with an interest in mathematics whom have only expeirenced highschool level mathematics.

This is my first expeirence with the manim library and thus stands to be improved in all aspects.
Not to mention this isn't planning to be put anywhere, so the willingness to do this with the utmost of greatest quality is evidently dwindling.
