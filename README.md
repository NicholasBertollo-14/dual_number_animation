# Dual Number System

This is an animation I created to learn manim.
It's aimed at high school student with an interest in mathematics,
however has only expeirenced highschoo level mathematics.

This is my first expeirence with the manim library and
thus stands to be improved in all aspects.

Currently a work in progress, trying to motivate why derivatives 
are worth being able to calculate.
